This repository is organized as follows:

a) measurement_data
Contains 6 sofa files of HRTFs of a Kemar dummy head wearing each of the tested conditions.

b) listening_test
Contains
  - Results: raw results for colouration and localization tests
  - Analysis: scripts for the analysis of the listening test results
  - Stimuli for colouration and localization tests
  
c) model
Contains:
  - Colouration: CLL-based model to predict colouration from the measurement_data (sofa files)
  - Localization: Evaluation of the models may2011 and baumgartner2014 to predict the localization data.
                  These models are available in the Auditory Modelling Toolbox (https://amtoolbox.org/).

d) dependencies
